# html2any
> aim to covert html string to your customized format/components.

While building websites, people may met issues for rendering rich text into different formats.
For example, I've got an `<video>` tag, but I wanna render it with my own React/Vue/Angular or some customized component.
But I also want to render the whole html easily rather than parse it manually.

Now `html2any` help you to render html string. It not only parses your html but also gives you ability to transform it from origin to the dest.
